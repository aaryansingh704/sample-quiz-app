# sample-quiz-app
I learnt the concepts of this project from a youtuber called "codewithharry". the frontend is simple and the main point of this project is intent passing from 
one activity to another. the questions are sort of hardcoded. By hardcoded I mean they are kept in the strings resource directory and not accessed from a database. 
the resource folders are also uploaded in this project.
